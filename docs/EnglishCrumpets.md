## Ingredients

- 180g / 6.3 oz Plain or All-purpose flour
- 235g / 235 mls Lukewarm water / 40°C / 104°F
- 4g / 1 tsp Instant or active dried yeast
- 4g / ½ tsp Salt
- 4g / 1 tsp Baking powder
- 6g / 1 tsp Sugar
- 1 Tbsp Olive oil & 30g / 1 oz soft butter, for greasing the crumpet rings

## Method

- You will need 4 to 6 crumpet rings/moulds for this recipe.
- Add the sugar and yeast to the warm water, mix well and allow the yeast to activate for 10 minutes until it foams up.
- Add the now active yeast mixture to a bowl.
- Add the flour and salt to the bowl, and sift in the baking powder, push any lumps through with your fingers.

- Using a hand whisk, beat the mixture together for 2 minutes.
- Halfway through the whisking, scrape down the sides of the bowl, then continue whisking for the rest of the 2 minutes.
- If you are using an electric whisk, beat for only 1 minute.
- Scrape down the sides of the again, cover the bowl, and rest it in a warm spot for 45 minutes.
- Near the end of the 45 minutes, heat up a large non stick frying pan to a temperature of 190°C that’s 375°F.
- Add the olive oil and soft butter to a bowl.
- Using a pastry brush, coat the inside of one of the rings with the butter and oil mixture.
- Place the ring into the hot pan.
- Your crumpet mix should now be active and bubbly.
- Spoon the mixture into the hot ring to about halfway up.
- Do the same for 3 more rings, don’t overcrowd the pan, you need space to move the rings around.
- It is very important to keep the temperature correct and constant at 190°C that’s 375°F, any hotter the bottoms will burn before the tops are cooked.
- After 5 minutes the classic crumpet bubbles will start to appear from the edges of the crumpets.
- You can use a small pointy knife to pop any stubborn bubbles.
- Once the mixture has dried out around the edges, use your oven mitts to lift off the rings.
- Once you see that the middles are less gooey, you can carefully turn them over to brown off the tops.
- Once golden brown, remove them from the pan and onto a wire rack to cool.
- Once completely cool, you can freeze these or keep them in your fridge until needed.
- To serve these wonderful crumpets, toast them for 3 minutes, serve with butter and jam whilst still piping hot.
- Or any topping of your choice.
- Enjoy
